# Day 3 â€“ Python Loops Projects  

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python projects built using **loops** (`for` and `while`) 

---

##  What I Learned on Day 3: 
- `for` loop and `while` loop basics
- Looping with `range()`
- Counting, conditions, and pattern-based iteration
- Handling lists with `append()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, `len()`

---

##  Projects Built 

### 1. **Multiplication Table Generator (2 to 20)**
Prints multiplication tables from 2 to 20 using nested `for` loops.

 ### 2. Daily Expense Tracker
Tracks expenses, calculates total, average, highest and lowest expense from a list.    

### 3.Login Authentication System (While Loop)
Simulates a login system that allows up to 3 attempts before blocking access.  

Concepts Covered
for, while loops
range(), nested loops
if, else, elif inside loops
List operations: .append(), sum(), len(), max(), min()
Real-life automation use-cases
